# Daily-C-program
My daily 60 minutes C programming and practice problems.
My first program in GitHub!!
simple calculator.
used switch case conditional statement
My second C program in GitHub!!
check palindrome or not!!
1.Understand the given question.
2.Understand what are inputs and outputs.
3.Use loop.
4.Compare reversed number and given number.
3rd
gradeforstudents depend on their score.
i have used if else laddar.
TODAY,
i did 2 programs fibonacci series and then largest of 3 numbers.
while typing the code of fibonacci i just made many mistakes and then i made it up i went through my mistakes and then i got my output correctly. 
today i started my coding at lab itslef i made many mistakes and then i went to sir he taught me....even though i wrote the code in my laptop i got the incorrect output then i learned from my proffessor he taught me very well.
this was my contribution 1 [nxm matrix].
my contribution 2 was a electricity bill.
20th nov
i was just confused about the type c conversion so today i just syudied it again and now i have cleared my doubts.Now i will practice more and more programs.
I have guven a real world example for type c conversion where i have calculated the user's percentage.
21st nov
Today i have practised a program in arithmetic operations.
I wrote a code for findind and comparision and biggest of 2 no's.
22nd nov
I wrote a program using logical operators with bool expression.
the 2nd program was reverseofdigits using a two digit number.
23rd nov
tpday i have wrote a code on sumofdigits.
24th nov
due to health issues today i just did only program.
26th nov
today i jyst started my 60 mins iun lab itself,where i haven learnt about sum of each row and column.
28th nov
Due to my health issues i couldn't do practice well in this week so today i will do my code.
I don't know what is happening to me im getting so much of health issues so i'll try to code everyday after my health gets better,then also i just wrote a code on quadratic equation today where already i have done it before in the college itself so i did it fast.
29th nov
Today i learnt about booleans and then conditionnal statements in w3schools where i have already know some little bit about it so today i just glanced about those.
after that i wrote a code on check whether the given year is a leap year.
now,i just understood the code of counting the digits at first after reading the concept i just used while loop it was correct but i forgot aboout the incremnt and then i took a glance of the code in my lab material after that i understood well.
30th nov
i have learnt about conditonal statements and then i wrote a code on finding a day using switch statement.
My 2nd code is product of all the digits in a given number i got the logic correctly but i have missed some while loop conditions and then i just corrected myself........
1st dec
today i have practised 3 programs
1st = printing odd and even numbers using while loop
2nd = reverse of digits not just 2 digits
3rd = sum and product using forloop
3rd dec
Today i wrote a program using while loop where i did a mistake in that..i have missed the part of using 0 means i forgot to stop the loop.After that i just corrected it.
4th dec
im trying my best to do more problems but im getting so sad because it tooooo hard i will try again and again.
I'am struggling a lot i dont know what is happening why im feeling it is so hard but also i have tried a program with minor mistake.
7th dec
COntinously i have missed my 2 days of practising so today i have practised total 3 programs where it was an easy program and already i have done those programs in my lab.
9th dec
Due to my health issues i couldn't do my c program properly  
so today i have done a program where it was teached by my teacher in class,the porgram was about counting a vowel in a gievn word using string function.
10th dec
today  i did 3 programs at my lab itself.
1.about pointers
2.insertion of an element in an array.
3.swapping using pointers.
13th Dec
Due to my health issues and internals on monday i couldn't do coding properly for 2 days but today i learnt functions in C which is very important topic for my IA2.
i was struggling to learn i learnt inly little bit thats it i have more and more to learn.
14th Dec
I have my IA2 exams from tomorrow so i will do my 60 mins of practice tomorrow and i will not do on tuesday again coz of physics on wednesday.after that i will continue my practise.
22nd Dec
Due to my IA2 i didn't practice C code for one week.
Today i have learnt about continue and break statement in w3schools.
24th Dec
Today i will learn about theory and then i will solve some problems.
26th
I have added a program to check whether the given number is even or odd using array functions.
27th Dec
Even though i learnt some things in functions,i was just struggling to write a function but now i learnt it deeply nand also i wrote a code feeling light about functions now but not fully light, and i will try it again and again i will practice some programs also based on functions.
28th Dec
i have learnt functions before and now i learnt it with ae= example where i have done 5-6 programs based on functions.
29th Dec
I did a program on factorial using functions.
jan 1st 2026
tomorrow i have practical exam so i practised recursion concept and some programs.
6th jan 2026
Today i learnt about bubblesort and i have understood the concept very well.
I learnt about recursion and pointers , also i did programming every day since 5 days.
Learnt about strings some basics only,but i need to practise for my final practical exam and now i'am okay with the logics!! Getting the concept easily..
Today i learnt 2 programs which were aboout the strings and i have my final exam on this month 16th jan.
im practising daily one program ...
and now toady i have to prepare for my lab exams tomorrow(16th jan).
Im done with all the concepts in C programming.
from tomorrow i have to focus on my theory.
