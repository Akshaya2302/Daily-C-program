#Daily C Programming Practice

Welcome to my C programming journey! I am a B.Tech CSE student, and this repository tracks my goal of practicing C programming for **60 minutes every day**.

Here, you will find solutions to various logical problems, data structures, and algorithms as I prepare for my semester exams and build my foundation.

#📚 Topics Covered
- [x] Basic Input/Output & Arithmetic
- [x] Conditional Statements (If-Else, Switch)
- [x] Loops (While, Do-While, For)
- [x] Functions
- [x] Arrays (1D & 2D) & Strings
- [x] Pointers & Memory Management
- [x] Structures
- [x] Recursion
## Daily Learning Log

### **Phase 1: The Basics (Conditionals & Loops)**
* **Day 1:** My first program on GitHub! A **Simple Calculator** using `switch` case statements.
* **Day 2:** Palindrome Checker.
   Logic:Loop to reverse the number $\rightarrow$ Compare with original.
* **Day 3:** Student Grading System using `if-else` ladder.
* **Day 4:** Fibonacci Series & Largest of 3 Numbers.
    * *Reflections:* Made syntax errors initially but debugged them to get the correct output.

### **Phase 2: Arrays & Logic Building (Nov 20 - Nov 30)**
* **Nov 20:**  Type Conversion. calculated user percentage to understand implicit/explicit casting.
* **Nov 21:**  Arithmetic Operations (Comparisons & logic).
* **Nov 22:** Boolean Logic & Reversing a 2-digit number.
* **Nov 23:** Sum of Digits calculation.
* **Nov 26:** **Matrix Operations:** Sum of rows and columns (NxM Matrix).
* **Nov 29:** Leap Year Check & Digit Counting.
    * *Key Learning:* Mastered `while` loop conditions and incrementing logic.
* **Nov 30:** Day Finder (Switch) & Product of Digits.

### Phase 3: Deep Dive into Logic (Dec 1 - Dec 10)**
* Dec 1:
    1.  Odd/Even printing (While loop).
    2.  Reverse of digits (Any length).
    3.  Sum & Product (For loop).
* Dec 3 : Addressed infinite loop errors (forgot to update the loop variable).
* Dec 9 : Strings:  Counting vowels in a word.
* Dec 10 : Pointers & Arrays:
    1.  Pointer basics.
    2.  Inserting an element into an array.
    3.  Swapping variables using pointers.

### **Phase 4: Functions & Exam Prep (Dec 13 - Jan 1)**
* **Dec 13 - 27:** **Functions.**
    * Started with basic theory.
    * Implemented Odd/Even checks using Array functions.
    * Wrote 5-6 practice programs to master passing parameters.
* **Dec 29:** Factorial using Functions.
* **Jan 1, 2026:** **Recursion.** Practiced recursive logic for the upcoming practical exam.

### **Phase 5: Advanced Concepts & Sorting (Jan 6 - Present)**
* **Jan 6:** **Bubble Sort.** Understood the sorting logic clearly.
* **Jan 10:** String Manipulation (Basics & Logic).
* **Jan 19:** **Structures.** Posted code demonstrating C Structures.
* **Jan 20:** Learned about more `structurs` programs.
* **Jan 21:** Insertion and deletion an element in an array.
## Reflections
* **Challenges:** Faced health issues in November/December which broke my streak, but I remained consistent whenever possible.
* **Growth:** Initially struggled with syntax errors and logic building, but after practicing concepts like Pointers and Recursion, I feel much more confident.
* **Current Status:** Completed Module 1 (C Basics). Now shifting focus to theory and final exam preparation.
